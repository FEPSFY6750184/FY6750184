This paper will go over the theory behind Aerospike engines, a type of altitude-compensating rocket motor designed to maintain efficiency over a wider range of altitudes than dynamically a traditional engine. We will cover how air pressure affects traditional engine nozzles and what methods we use to compensate for it. How Aerospikes use air pressure to guide the size of their theoretical engine bell. Both earlier and modern tests of Aerospike design as well as their limitations in practical use. Such designs still hold weight in modern spacecraft considerations and may be an important step in the development of multi-use  planetary landers, such as a potential Mars mission. This paper intends to provide a brief understanding of how the physics of these engines works and why, for the most part, there has been a lacklustre attempt to adopt these engines into any current spacecraft designs.

	<h3 id="rocketnozzle">How Rocket Nozzles function</h3>
<p class="ex1">

As rocket fuel ignites, the momentum of the gas particles is initially exerted in all directions, with only a tiny percentage moving directly down away from the engine, creating thrust. (Dieter K. Huzel & David H. Huang) A thrust chamber fixes this by confining the expanding gas, stopping the outwards expansion. The gas is then forced into the nozzle through a throat, compressing the gas. The nozzle's shape slowly diverges, causing the compressed gas to expand and ‘choke’, creating a supersonic jet dramatically accelerating the gas away from the engine. (Dieter K. Huzel & David H. Huang) At Higher ambient pressures, however, the surrounding air affects exhaust, compressing the Plume, reducing its momentum. If the Nozzle is not adjusted the gas will over expand, reducing ISP. (Erin M. Betts and Dr. Robert A. Frederick, Jr) ISP or Specific impulse is the thrust of an engine over the rate of fuel it consumes. Simplified, it’s how long an engine would burn if one unit of fuel in weight were used to continuously produce one unit of thrust. A higher ISP means that the engine can use the fuel more efficiently to generate thrust for a longer time. (V.K. Bhat, A.R. Kulkarni and Haridwar Singh) The Engine nozzle shape must account for atmospheric compression to ensure maximum ISP. (Erin M. Betts and Dr. Robert A. Frederick, Jr) Issues arise as the rocket travels through the atmosphere. Ambient pressure is dependent on altitude. So as the rocket rises the ambient pressure on the exhaust plume decreases, causing the exhaust to under-expand As such, most rocket nozzles are designed to operate at a specific ambient pressure depending on their shape. (Dieter K. Huzel and David H. Huang)

<p class="ex1">

Aerospike engines intend to solve this issue. Rather than forcing exhaust through into an engine nozzle or bell, an aerospike directs the gas along the edge of a curved surface. This curve follows the traditional rocket nozzle shape. The ambient air pressure then acts against the outflow or exhaust, stopping expansion outwards; this creates a barrier where the super-sonic exhaust can no longer push standing air out of the way, referred to as the free jet boundary. (J. J. Korte) A second curved surface is placed against the first, forming the wedge or ‘Spike’ from which the design gets its name., constricting the exhaust. As the atmospheric pressure decreases, the force against the exhaust also decreases, expanding the virtual nozzle's size. This nozzle expansion with altitude means an aerospike can maintain peak efficiency throughout its flight. (J. J. Korte)

<h3 id="rocketdyne">RocketDyne Testing</h3>

<p class="ex1">

In the 1960s, Rocketdyne performed several tests on aerospike engines. They used toroidal aerospike. A variation of an aerospike where the exhaust is directed along the edge of a curved cone. (LAP 67-473) This produces a similar effect to a linear aerospike, but its shape makes it easier to integrate with traditional rocket designs. A 75-, 100- and 125-inch engine diameter were used. Respectively producing 1100-, 1550-, and 2001kN thrust in a vacuum, similar to the J-2 engine used on the Saturn 5. (LAP 67-473)  The ISP of the engines at peak performance was 420s, the same as we see in the J-2 engine. However, at sea level, where the J-2 can only produce an ISP of 200s, the aerospike engines could generate an ISP of up to 380s, dramatically increasing engine efficiency. (LAP 67-473) Rocketdyne did several follow-up studies showing similar results, and more promising data was reproduced with NASA and Rocketdyne’s Linear XRS-2000. Such results encouraged engineers, and in 1996, after a series of design competitions, Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works were contracted to construct a large SSTO nicknamed the VentureStar. (M. K. Lockwood)

<h3 id="venturestar">The VentureStar Project</h3>

<p class="ex1">

The VentureStar was an ambitious project, posing to replace the Space shuttle. It would have stood at a height of 38.7m with a similar width of 38m. It was designed as a sizeable lifting body, intended to launch vertically and land horizontally, similar to the flight path of the space shuttle. (Allen Li) Sadly, after only five years of development, the project was scrapped. In a postmortem report, NASA cited technical issues in the craft's weight. (Allen Li)  For an SSTO to reach orbit, the craft's dry mass must be 10% of the fully fuelled mass. This restriction meant that composite materials had to be used, but with little research at the time and a dramatic failure of a composite fuel tank during testing, the project was never completed. (Allen Li) The mass issue was also not helped by the Linear aerospike. In a traditional nozzle, heat can radiate away from the engine through the Nozzle wall, reducing the need for cooling. An Aerospike engine, however, has no outward-facing walls. The exhaust plume completely encompasses the nozzle. This heat is not radiated readily from the spike, requiring complex cooling systems to avoid melting. This cooling system adds significant weight. (M. G. D'Agostino, Y. C. Lee, T. S. Wang) Another issue uncovered during wind tunnel tests is Mach cone separation. Between Mach 1-3 air speeds, the shockwave around the craft would create an area of low pressure directly next to the engines. This reduced the force pushing against the engine's nozzle, causing the plume to expand, reducing the efficiency, and capping the maximum thrust of the engine. (R.A. O'Leary and J. E. Beck)

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p class="ex1">

Following the failure of the VentureStar project and the increasing popularity of reusable first-stage systems, such as SpaceX’s Falcon 9. It's unlikely that any significant development will be made in Aerospike engines. The lack of actual flight data, increased design challenges, and higher weight make them an impractical choice for any vertical launch system. Recent developments have occurred in the aerospike's use in a space plane configuration; a German company named Polaris Aerospace is currently in the stages of testing a 4.3m comprehensive scale model of their future MIRA space plane and plans to power this craft via a linear aerospike. Whether this comes to fruition is still up for debate. (POLARIS Raumflugzeuge GmbH)
