This paper will go over the theory behind Aerospike engines, a type of altitude-compensating rocket motor designed to maintain efficiency over a wider range of altitudes than dynamically a traditional engine. We will cover how air pressure affects traditional engine nozzles and what methods we use to compensate for it. How Aerospikes use air pressure to guide the size of their theoretical engine bell. Both earlier and modern tests of Aerospike design as well as their limitations in practical use. Such designs still hold weight in modern spacecraft considerations and may be an important step in the development of multi-use  planetary landers, such as a potential Mars mission. This paper intends to provide a brief understanding of how the physics of these engines works and why, for the most part, there has been a lacklustre attempt to adopt these engines into any current spacecraft designs.

<p class="ex1">

As rocket fuel ignites, the momentum of the gas particles is initially exerted in all directions, only a small percentage in moving directly down away from the engine creating thrust. A thrust chamber fixes this by confining the expanding gas stopping the outwards expansion. The gas is then forced through a series through a throat into the nozzle. The nozzles shape slowly diverges, causing the expanding gas to ‘choke’ creating a supersonic jet of exhaust dramatically accelerating the gas away from the engine. (Dieter K. Huzel and David H. Huang) At Higher ambient pressures however, the surrounding air has an effect exhaust. As it exits the nozzle the exhaust must be at the same ambient pressure as the static air around it. Too low and the plume expands, too high and it is compressed. This reduces the thrust efficiency of the engine referred to as ISP. (Erin M. Betts and Dr. Robert A. Frederick, Jr) For context ISP or Specific impulse is the thrust of an engine over the rate of fuel it consumes. simplified it’s how long an engine would burn if one unit of fuel in weight was used to produce one unit of thrust continuously. Higher ISP means that the engine is able to use the fuel more efficiently to generate thrust for a longer time. (V.K. Bhat, A.R. Kulkarni and Haridwar Singh) The Engine nozzles shape must be designed to account for atmospheric compression to ensure maximum ISP. Issues arise as the rocket travels through the atmosphere. As altitude increases pressure decreases. Meaning the compressive effect, the atmosphere has on the plume weakens. The Exhaust plume will no longer have the same atmospheric pressure confining it, reducing the ISP of the engine. As such most rocket nozzles are designed to operate at a specific ambient pressure depending on their shape. (Dieter K. Huzel and David H. Huang)
